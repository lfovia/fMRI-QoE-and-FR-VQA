# fMRI-QoE-and-FR-VQA
Evaluation of Quality of Experience and Full reference Video Quality Assessment using fMRI voxel models of Alex-Net

This is the implementation of our ICASSP 2021 paper VIDEO QUALITY PREDICTION USING VOXEL-WISE MODELS OF THE VISUAL CORTEX. In this repository, we provide code code for training the voxel models and testing them for the video quality prediction.
